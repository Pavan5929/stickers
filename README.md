This project creates dynamic name tag stickers with a fun, colorful design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each name tag is randomly assigned a background color and rotation to give it a playful effect. The page automatically refreshes every second to re-render the stickers with new styles.

Technologies Used
HTML: Defines the structure of the page.
CSS: Styles the page, including fonts, colors, and layout.
JavaScript: Generates stickers dynamically and applies random effects.
How It Works
HTML Template:

The template element defines the structure of each sticker.
Stickers contain a greeting text ("Hi!"), label ("My name is"), and a name area populated dynamically by JavaScript.
CSS Styling:

The page uses a gradient background and a centered layout.
Stickers are given rounded corners, shadow effects, and transform animations for smooth transitions.
JavaScript Functionality:

A set of predefined names and colors is used.
JavaScript selects names from an array and assigns each a random color and rotation.
The stickers are added dynamically to the page.
Auto-refresh every second re-generates stickers with new styles.
Files Overview
index.html:
Contains the main structure with a <template> element for the stickers.

style.css:
Styles the body, stickers, and text. It ensures the layout is centered and visually appealing.

script.js:
Contains JavaScript logic to generate name stickers, apply random transformations, and refresh the page every second.
How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd name-tag-stickers

Usage Instructions

Project Demo
Hereâ€™s how the output looks:

Dynamic stickers with different names and random rotations.
Stickers get new colors and placements on each refresh.
Future Enhancements
Add user input for custom names.
Implement a pause button to stop auto-refresh.
Use local storage to retain stickers across page reloads.
